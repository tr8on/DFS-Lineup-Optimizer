## Project Description

I will be creating a lineup optimizer for daily fantasy sports (DFS). DFS is a highly competitive and analytical game, where people are constantly seeking an edge over one another.

- rails backend
- great design 
- display a lineup that meets restrictions

#### PostMVP 

- use a sorting algorthim to create a lineup

## Architectural Design

Define the the components and the architectural design of your app.

#### [SAMPLE FROM A MAP BASED PROJECT](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjtpejbw/image/upload/v1540221204/20181022_111216.jpg)

## ERD

Create the ERD model for your project

## UI Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 
 
 #### SAMPLE.....
| Library | What it Does | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Bootstrap | Used to help style my application | 
| Giphy API | Used to get gifs to use |
